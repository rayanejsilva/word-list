# Retrospective

## WEEK 2

### **Stop Doing**

- Don't use the debugger statement and break points to explore my code.

### **Continue Doing**

- Developing my solutions on a separate branch.

### **Start Doing**

- Add task labels to a user story.
- Link my PR to a user story issue on the project board.

### **Lessons Learned**

- Split code into multiple files, regular expression, ternary operator and conditional chains, event propagation, event capturing, render list strings and spread operator.
